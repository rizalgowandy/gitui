# Contributing

We’re glad you found this document that is intended to make contributing to
GitUI as easy as possible!

## Building GitUI

In order to build GitUI on your machine, follow the instructions in the
[“Build” section](./README.md#build).

## Getting help

There’s a [Discord server][discord-server] you can join if you get stuck or
don’t know where to start. People are happy to answer any questions you might
have!

## Getting started

If you are looking for something to work on, but don’t yet know what might be a
good first issue, you can take a look at [issues labelled with
`good-first-issue`][good-first-issues]. They have been selected to not require
too much context so that people not familiar with the codebase yet can still
make a contribution.
