# Themes

default on light terminal:

To change the colors of the default theme you need to add a `theme.ron` file that contains the colors you want to override. Note that you don’t have to specify the full theme anymore (as of 0.23). Instead, it is sufficient to override just the values that you want to differ from their default values.

The file uses the [Ron format](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) and is located at one of the following paths, depending on your operating system:

* `$HOME/.config/gitui/theme.ron` (mac)
* `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gitui/theme.ron` (linux using XDG)
* `$HOME/.config/gitui/theme.ron` (linux)
* `%APPDATA%/gitui/theme.ron` (Windows)

Alternatively, you can create a theme in the same directory mentioned above and use it with the `-t` flag followed by the name of the file in the directory. E.g. If you are on linux calling `gitui -t arc.ron`, this will load the theme in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gitui/arc.ron` or `$HOME/.config/gitui/arc.ron`.

Example theme override:

```
(
    selection_bg: Some("Blue"),
    selection_fg: Some("#ffffff"),
)
```

Note that you need to wrap values in `Some` due to the way the overrides work (as of 0.23).

Notes:

* rgb colors might not be supported in every terminal.
* using a color like `yellow` might appear in whatever your terminal/theme defines for `yellow`
* valid colors can be found in ratatui's [Color](https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/style/enum.Color.html) struct.
* all customizable theme elements can be found in [`style.rs` in the `impl Default for Theme` block](https://github.com/extrawurst/gitui/blob/master/src/ui/style.rs#L305)

## Customizing line breaks

If you want to change how the line break is displayed in the diff, you can also specify `line_break` in your `theme.ron`:

```
(
    line_break: Some("¶"),
)
```

Note that if you want to turn it off, you should use a blank string:

```
(
    line_break: Some(""),
)
```
